Some functional interfaces seen in this repo are:

1) Consumer
2) Function
3) Predicate
4) Supplier

Combinator Pattern
"The functional pattern representing a style of organizing libraries centered around the idea of combining functions."

Callbacks, lambdas, optionals and streams complete the list of the subjects. 

Functional programming leads to a more transparent, cleaner code that helps the user in debugging and maintenance, 
and is fast becoming the go-to method for developers.
